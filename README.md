## NHL Goal Siren

A program to light a siren and play a sound effect any time your favorite NHL team scores a goal. 

This program was designed for use with a Raspberry Pi which toggles the siren with a GPIO pin. It also supports a simple interface with a button and three LEDs for cycling through four preset delay settings to synchronize when a goal occurs and when the siren activates. The program can be installed as a systemd service using the provided template to make the program automatically run on boot.
